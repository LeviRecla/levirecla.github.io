        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated Computer Science student pursuing both B.S. and M.S. degrees at Boise State University. 
            My work focuses on machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and natural language processing, 
            including automated code translation between languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a minor in Physics, I combine a strong mathematical and scientific background with a passion for software 
            development. I have experience converting legacy Fortran code to Python, applying genetic algorithms to self-absorption 
            correction, and working with data from the James Webb Space Telescope.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I have hands-on experience in data analysis, management, and leadership roles. 
            I thrive on problem-solving, teamwork, and continuous learning.
        </p>
