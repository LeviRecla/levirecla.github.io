      <p>
        I am a software engineer and researcher with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Physics from Boise State University.
        I am currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science with a focus on machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning,
        and natural language processing. My academic and research interests lie in automated code translation using large language models,
        with practical work in converting legacy scientific code from Fortran to Python.

        My recent work includes spectral classification of 1D JWST data, language model fine-tuning, and research on automating
        Fortran-to-Python translation. I presented this work at the 2025 Undergraduate Research Showcase and was honored with the
        <strong style="color: #0077cc;">Excellence in Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity Award</strong>.

        Professionally, I have worked as a Data Analyst Intern and a university Teaching Assistant in Data Science.
        In Summer 2025, I will be joining Micron Technology as an <strong>ETD Software Engineer Intern</strong>,
        where I will be working on GenAI systems and full-stack software development.

        I thrive on solving challenging problems, exploring emerging technologies, and working at the intersection of science and code.
        With a strong foundation in math and physics, I enjoy applying theory to practical real-world systems through clear, efficient code.
